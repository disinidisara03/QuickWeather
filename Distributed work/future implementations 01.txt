Heroku servers:
Heroku is a container-based cloud
Platform as a Service (PaaS). 
Developers use Heroku to deploy, manage, and scale modern apps.
Heroku is fully managed, giving developers the freedom to focus on their core 
product without the distraction of maintaining servers, 
hardware, or infrastructure.


Load Balancing:
The load balancer works to steer the traffic to a pool of available servers through various load balancing algorithms.
If more resources are needed, additional servers can be added.


Middleware:
Middleware is software that lies between an operating system and the applications running on it. 
Essentially functioning as hidden translation layer,
middleware enables communication and data management for distributed applications.


API:
An application programming interface (API) is a set of tools, definitions, and protocols for integrating application software and services.
It's the stuff that lets your products and services communicate with other products and services without having to constantly 
build new connectivity infrastructure.
