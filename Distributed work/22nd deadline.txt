middleware - dilhani and nilhan 
APIs and templates - shikari and disini
heterogenity - dewni and mujeeb 

•	Managing Heterogeneity: The distributed system must consist of at least three devices communicating with each other. 
At least one device must be a PC or virtual machine running on a PC. One other device must be a mobile networked device.
 The mobile device, typically acting as a client, will be running an embedded operating system such as Windows Mobile OS, Apple iOS or Android.
 Other networked computers may include your own laptop. 
•	Your system should be robust and responsive, and tolerant to network failures.
•	Choosing Middleware: You need to select a middleware in implementation and the use of suitable middleware will attract marks.
 You must be able to justify your choice of middleware in terms of the application architecture and functionality.
•	You are expected to make use of legally available software components, APIs, templates, etc.  
However, YOU MUST DECLARE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE USED in your report and explain how and why you have used them.
